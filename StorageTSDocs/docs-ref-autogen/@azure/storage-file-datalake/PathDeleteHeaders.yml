      When deleting a directory, the number of paths that are deleted with each
      invocation is

      limited.  If the number of paths to be deleted exceeds this limit, a

      returned in this response header.  When a continuation token is returned
      in the response, it

      must be specified in a subsequent invocation of the delete operation to
      continue deleting the

      directory.
