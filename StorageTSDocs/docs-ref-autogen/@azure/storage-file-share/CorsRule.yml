      CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one
      domain to access

      resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a security restriction
      known as same-origin

      policy that prevents a web page from calling APIs in a different domain;
      CORS provides a secure

      way to allow one domain (the origin domain) to call APIs in another
      domain.

      can also use the wildcard character '*' to allow all origin domains to
      make requests via CORS.
