  CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one
  domain to access

  resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a security restriction
  known as same-origin

  policy that prevents a web page from calling APIs in a different domain; CORS
  provides a secure

  way to allow one domain (the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain.

      can also use the wildcard character '*' to allow all origin domains to
      make requests via CORS.
