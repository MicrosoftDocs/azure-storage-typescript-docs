      The ETag contains a value which represents the version of the share
      snapshot, in quotes. A

      share snapshot cannot be modified, so the ETag of a given share snapshot
      never changes.

      However, if new metadata was supplied with the Snapshot Share request then
      the ETag of the

      share snapshot differs from that of the base share. If no metadata was
      specified with the

      request, the ETag of the share snapshot is identical to that of the base
      share at the time the

      share snapshot was taken.
