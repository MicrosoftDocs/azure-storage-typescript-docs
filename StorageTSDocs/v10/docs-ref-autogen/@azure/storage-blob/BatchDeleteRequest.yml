      Add a delete operation(subrequest) to mark the specified blob or snapshot
      for deletion.

      Note that in order to delete a blob, you must delete all of its snapshots.

      You can delete both at the same time. See [delete operation
      details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/delete-blob).

      The operation(subrequest) will be authenticated and authorized with
      specified credential.
