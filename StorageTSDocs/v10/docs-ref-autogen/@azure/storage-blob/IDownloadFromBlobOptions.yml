      Optional. ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS.

      How many retries will perform when original block download stream
      unexpected ends.

      Above kind of ends will not trigger retry policy defined in a pipeline,

      because they doesn't emit network errors.


      With this option, every additional retry means an additional
      FileURL.download() request will be made

      from the broken point, until the requested block has been successfully
      downloaded or

      maxRetryRequestsPerBlock is reached.


      Default value is 5, please set a larger value when in poor network.
