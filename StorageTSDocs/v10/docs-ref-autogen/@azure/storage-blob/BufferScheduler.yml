### YamlMime:TSType
name: BufferScheduler
uid: '@azure/storage-blob.BufferScheduler'
package: '@azure/storage-blob'
summary: >-
  This class accepts a Node.js Readable stream as input, and keeps reading data

  from the stream into the internal buffer structure, until it reaches
  maxBuffers.

  Every available buffer will try to trigger outgoingHandler.

  The internal buffer structure includes an incoming buffer array, and a
  outgoing

  buffer array. The incoming buffer array includes the "empty" buffers can be
  filled

  with new incoming data. The outgoing array includes the filled buffers to be

  handled by outgoingHandler. Every above buffer size is defined by parameter
  bufferSize.


  NUM_OF_ALL_BUFFERS = BUFFERS_IN_INCOMING + BUFFERS_IN_OUTGOING +
  BUFFERS_UNDER_HANDLING


  NUM_OF_ALL_BUFFERS <= maxBuffers


  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TIPS:

  1. Input stream highWaterMark is better to set a same value with bufferSize
     parameter, which will avoid Buffer.concat() operations.
  2. Parallelism should set a smaller value than maxBuffers, which is helpful to
     reduce the possibility when a outgoing handler waits for the stream data.
     in this situation, outgoing handlers are blocked.
     Outgoing queue shouldn't be empty.
