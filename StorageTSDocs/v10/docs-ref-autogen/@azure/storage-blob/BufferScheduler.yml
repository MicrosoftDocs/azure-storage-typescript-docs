    summary: >-
      This class accepts a Node.js Readable stream as input, and keeps reading
      data

      from the stream into the internal buffer structure, until it reaches
      maxBuffers.

      Every available buffer will try to trigger outgoingHandler.

      The internal buffer structure includes an incoming buffer array, and a
      outgoing

      buffer array. The incoming buffer array includes the "empty" buffers can
      be filled

      with new incoming data. The outgoing array includes the filled buffers to
      be

      handled by outgoingHandler. Every above buffer size is defined by
      parameter bufferSize.


      NUM_OF_ALL_BUFFERS = BUFFERS_IN_INCOMING + BUFFERS_IN_OUTGOING +
      BUFFERS_UNDER_HANDLING


      NUM_OF_ALL_BUFFERS <= maxBuffers


      PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TIPS:

      1. Input stream highWaterMark is better to set a same value with
      bufferSize
         parameter, which will avoid Buffer.concat() operations.
      2. Parallelism should set a smaller value than maxBuffers, which is
      helpful to
         reduce the possibility when a outgoing handler waits for the stream data.
         in this situation, outgoing handlers are blocked.
         Outgoing queue shouldn't be empty.
