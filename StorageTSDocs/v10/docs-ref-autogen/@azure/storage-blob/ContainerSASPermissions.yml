      This is a helper class to construct a string representing the permissions
      granted by a ServiceSAS to a container.

      Setting a value to true means that any SAS which uses these permissions
      will grant permissions for that operation.

      Once all the values are set, this should be serialized with toString and
      set as the permissions field on a

      <xref:IBlobSASSignatureValues> object. It is possible to construct the
      permissions string without this class, but

      the order of the permissions is particular and this class guarantees
      correctness.
